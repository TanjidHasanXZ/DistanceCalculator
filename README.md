# Distance Calculator Project

## Overview

This project calculates the total distance between a series of geographical waypoints using their latitude and longitude coordinates. The distance is computed in kilometers using the Haversine formula.

## Features

- Input a series of geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- Calculate the distance between each pair of consecutive waypoints.
- Sum the distances to get the total travel distance.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `math.h`)

## Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gcc -o distance_calculator distanceCalculator.c -lm
